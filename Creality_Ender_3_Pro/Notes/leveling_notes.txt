How to level 3D printer bed
	-when bed is level, position between bed and nozzle
is always the same everywhere
		-not always possible, there will be 
			low and high spots

	- ^ use file to place print head at 5 locations
		on print bed and adjust bed; place paper
		between nozzle and bed until it barely 
		moves; BARELY SLIDE OUT, SIGNIFICANT

	- when printing, rub finger against print to
		see if print knocks off, if not sticky,
			then print will get knocked off
			- this means screw must be brought
				closer to nozzle
			-CW is closer, CCW is farther
	- best to leave bed there and not peel, cause it can
	affect bed level
